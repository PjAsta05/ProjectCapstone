# Mobile Development Team

Mobile Development team created the user interface design in Figma and followed Material Design principles to ensure a consistent and engaging user experience. For development, we used Android studio with Kotlin as the main program language.

## Description
Our project aims to revive interest in Balinese traditional dance among young people and tourists. The app combines dance scanning technology with interactive workshops to educate and foster appreciation for Balinese dance.
Users can scan dancers to access information about the dance style, movements, and cultural significance. Additionally, interactive workshops led by local artists provide hands-on experience and a platform for cultural exchange.

## Logo
The creation of our logo consists of several components, namely the letter A which is taken from the initial letter of the application, besides that there are ornaments that resemble a gate, which is a traditional Balinese gate. Furthermore, there are illustrations of people who are dancing that reflect the application that we make. In the color section we choose is based on the color of accessories that are often used by Balinese dancers.
